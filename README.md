# :coffee: The iOS coffee shortcut
Welcome to the iOS coffee shortcut repository.
This repository hosts the templates used by my iOS coffee shortcut as well as a little library of recipes you can import into the shortcut and brew for yourself.


Happy drinking :coffee:


# Get the shortcuts
## Brew coffee
Get the shortcut over here.

## Create a new coffee recipe
If you want to use my shortcut to make a new recipe and save it in shortcut-readable form, you can use this shortcut.

# How to use?
## Brew coffee from a recipe
You can load any recipe from the GitHub Repo via URL or download the .json file and load it from your local storage to have it on you where ever you are.

# Write your own recipe
## In pure JSON
If you already have a recipe and think you know what your are doing feel free to download the template recipe.json, fill it out and load it from a storage you control into the shortcut.

## The log
If you are as obsessed as I am you probably are going to log everything whenever you are trying out a new coffee, recipe etc. 
That's why I've developed another shortcut to help you set everything up and give you a starting point.

The log helps you to develop a recipe and save it locally as a JSON file which can be read by the "Brew coffee" shortcut.
